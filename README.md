# FederalBot: Discord's Democracy

A bot that was specifically made for my server, "United Discord Democracy", or U.D.D for short. It's a democratic server, with the people put first. This bot is the basis for the entire system.

This server is based off of "Reborn", which you can find the bot for [here.](https://github.com/Lunerr/reborn)

This is not a school project, or anything like that. Just wanted to make a good, unique bot for Discord.

* Go to dedicated JS servers

Don't go and complain to me if you don't know how to get these to work. Not my fault.

# FAQ's that are not frequently asked at all

Q: Can I help make this?
* A: Yes, but only if you have joined the server and are an experienced-enough JS/discord.js dev. 
* Q: But what does "experienced-enough" mean? Is there any concrete answer?
  * A: No. I will ask you to make something simple, then gradually go up in difficulty to see your spatial reasoning skills/how "advanced" you are at JS. I will also ask you to make me a simple bot in discord.js or discord.eris, whether you aren't able to do any JS besides discord.js and .eris, or you passed enough base JS tests. Contact me on Discord for more info.
   * Q: Okay, I've done that. What happens now?
     * A: You get a special role on the Discord server. I will not grant write access in the repo until you have proven to be a great help to the bot. Make PR's and issues frequently, and you can gain write access!

Q: Why did you make this?
* A: Your guess is as good as mine, but from what I remember it was to improve my JS skills as a whole.

Q: What's the point?
* A: Democracy. It doesn't work in the real world because free speech was a mistake, but works great on discord.

Q: Do you have other bots?
* A: Many. I may release them on github soon, but for now just this is here.

Q: Can I add this to my own server?
* A: Absolutely! Contact me on discord (shown at the top section) and I will tell you how you can set up the bot for your own server.

Ask me any questions on the discord server and I will happily answer them!
