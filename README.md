# FederalBot: Discord's Democracy
A bot that was specifically made for my server, "United Discord Democracy", or U.D.D for short. It's a democratic server, with the people put first. This bot is the basis for the entire system.

This server is based off of "Reborn", which you can find the bot for [here.](https://github.com/Lunerr/reborn)

This is not a school project, or anything like that. Just wanted to make a good, unique bot for Discord.
